# Libft | slucas-s
In 42 we dont have access to a lot of the standard C functions. But this project ask us to create our own library by replicating some of them and adding our own.

This repository includes all the mandatory and bonus funcions of the subject. As well as some extra functions that I've found useful to add in following projects.
